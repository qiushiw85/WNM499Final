In Italian, macchiato means stained or spotted so the literal translation of caffe macchiato is stained coffee, or coffee with a spot of milk."

The term as used in English is a shortened form of the Italian caffe latte, caffelatte or caffellatte, which means milk coffee. The word is also sometimes spelled latte or latte in English with different kinds of accent marks, which can be a hyperforeignism or a deliberate attempt to indicate that the word is not pronounced according to the rules of English orthography. Variants include replacing the coffee with another drink base such as masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate or matcha, and other types of milk, such as soy milk or almond milk are also used."

      "drinkHistory":"A cappuccino is an Italian coffee drink that is traditionally prepared with double espresso, hot milk, and steamed milk foam. Cream may be used instead of milk and is often topped with cinnamon. It is typically smaller in volume than a caff®® latte, with a thicker layer of micro foam. The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso crema and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the drink. The Italian cappuccino was unknown until the 1930s, and seems to be born out of Viennese-style cafes in Trieste and other cities in the former Austria in the first decades of the 20th century."

Like a caffe latte, caffe mocha is based on espresso and hot milk, but with added chocolate, typically in the form of sweet cocoa powder, although many varieties use chocolate syrup. Mochas can contain dark or milk chocolate. Caffe mochas typically contain the distinctive milk froth on top, although, as is common with hot chocolate, they are sometimes served with whipped cream instead. They are usually topped with a dusting of either cinnamon or cocoa powder, and marshmallows may also be added on top for flavor and decoration."

It is now common to have multiple scoops of ice cream so that in many cases the coffee is drowned by ice cream. Some variations also include a shot of amaretto, Bicerin or other liqueur. Many restaurants and cafes seem to struggle with deciding whether the affogato is a beverage or a dessert. This has led some to add such extravagances as coconut, berries, honeycomb and multiple flavours of ice cream in order to justify a much higher price tag."

The piston of the plunger is made of mesh, allowing liquid to flow through it but not the larger coffee grounds. With some coffee-brewing methods, the amount of brewed coffee you're trying to make and the grind size of your beans will affect how quickly the water will flow through the coffee and how long your total brew time will be. This is true for drip brewing, pourover, and even espresso."

Because of limitations on the availability of fresh milk, as the dairy farming industry was still in its infancy, the French and Vietnamese began to use sweetened condensed milk with a dark roast coffee."

      "drinkHistory":"A latte is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk. The term as used in English is a shortened form of the Italian caffe latte, caffelatte or caffellatte, which means milk coffee. The word is also sometimes spelled latte or latte in English with different kinds of accent marks, which can be a hyperforeignism or a deliberate attempt to indicate that the word is not pronounced according to the rules of English orthography. Variants include replacing the coffee with another drink base such as masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate or matcha, and other types of milk, such as soy milk or almond milk are also used."
