Macchiato sometimes called espresso macchiato, is an espresso coffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed. In Italian, macchiato means stained or spotted so the literal translation of caffe macchiato is stained coffee, or coffee with a spot of milk."

Variants include replacing the coffee with another drink base such as masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate or matcha, and other types of milk, such as soy milk or almond milk are also used."

Cream may be used instead of milk and is often topped with cinnamon. It is typically smaller in volume than a caff®® latte, with a thicker layer of micro foam. The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso crema and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the drink. The Italian cappuccino was unknown until the 1930s, and seems to be born out of Viennese-style cafes in Trieste and other cities in the former Austria in the first decades of the 20th century."

Mochas can contain dark or milk chocolate. Caffe mochas typically contain the distinctive milk froth on top, although, as is common with hot chocolate, they are sometimes served with whipped cream instead. They are usually topped with a dusting of either cinnamon or cocoa powder, and marshmallows may also be added on top for flavor and decoration."

It is now common to have multiple scoops of ice cream so that in many cases the coffee is drowned by ice cream. Some variations also include a shot of amaretto, Bicerin or other liqueur. Many restaurants and cafes seem to struggle with deciding whether the affogato is a beverage or a dessert. This has led some to add such extravagances as coconut, berries, honeycomb and multiple flavours of ice cream in order to justify a much higher price tag."

Vietnamese iced coffee is made using medium to coarse ground dark roast Vietnamese-grown coffee with a small metal Vietnamese drip filter. Coffee was introduced into Vietnam in 1857 by a French Catholic priest in the form of a single Coffea arabica tree. Because of limitations on the availability of fresh milk, as the dairy farming industry was still in its infancy, the French and Vietnamese began to use sweetened condensed milk with a dark roast coffee."

Like a caffe latte, caffe mocha is based on espresso and hot milk, but with added chocolate, typically in the form of sweet cocoa powder, although many varieties use chocolate syrup.

Caffe mochas typically contain the distinctive milk froth on top, although, as is common with hot chocolate, they are sometimes served with whipped cream instead. They are usually topped with a dusting of either cinnamon or cocoa powder, and marshmallows may also be added on top for flavor and decoration."
