Macchiato sometimes called espresso macchiato, is an espresso coffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed. In Italian, macchiato means stained or spotted so the literal translation of caffe macchiato is stained coffee, or coffee with a spot of milk."

Cream may be used instead of milk and is often topped with cinnamon. It is typically smaller in volume than a caff®® latte, with a thicker layer of micro foam. The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso crema and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the drink. The Italian cappuccino was unknown until the 1930s, and seems to be born out of Viennese-style cafes in Trieste and other cities in the former Austria in the first decades of the 20th century."

Caffe mochas typically contain the distinctive milk froth on top, although, as is common with hot chocolate, they are sometimes served with whipped cream instead. They are usually topped with a dusting of either cinnamon or cocoa powder, and marshmallows may also be added on top for flavor and decoration."

It is now common to have multiple scoops of ice cream so that in many cases the coffee is drowned by ice cream. Some variations also include a shot of amaretto, Bicerin or other liqueur. Many restaurants and cafes seem to struggle with deciding whether the affogato is a beverage or a dessert. This has led some to add such extravagances as coconut, berries, honeycomb and multiple flavours of ice cream in order to justify a much higher price tag."
